Description O
of O
a O
simulation R
system H 0
of O
a O
collecting R
machine H 0 2
. O

A O
computer R
system H 1
is O
required O
to O
simulate O
a O
machine H 2 2
for O
collecting O
bottles H 0 0-2
and O
cans H 0 0-2-0
. O

There O
can O
be O
several O
types H 0
of O
cans H 4 2
and O
several O
types H 5 0-0
of O
bottles H 3 0-0-2
. O

A O
type H 5
of O
cans H 4 2
is O
characterized O
by O
its H 4 0-1
width H 0 0-0-4
and O
height H 0 0-0-4-0
. O

One O
type H 5
of O
bottle H 3 2
is O
characterized O
by O
its H 3 0-1
neck R
width H 0 0-0-4
, O
bottom R
width H 0 0-0-4-0
and O
height H 0 0-0-4-0-0
. O

For O
each O
type H 5
, O
there O
is O
an O
amount H 0 4
of R
deposit R
; O
for O
example O
if O
a O
customer O
returns O
a O
can O
of O
Coca-Cola O
, O
the O
deposit O
amount O
is O
5 O
cents O
. O

The O
machine H 2
must O
therefore O
pay O
5 O
cents O
for O
each O
can O
of O
Coca-Cola O
returned O
. O

The O
system H 1
must O
be O
able O
to O
recognize O
the O
type H 5 2
of O
each O
item O
returned O
. O

He H 1
must O
also O
record O
the O
number O
of O
items O
( O
for O
each O
type O
) O
that O
a O
customer H 0 2
has O
returned O
and O
calculate O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
that O
the O
machine H 2 0-0
must O
pay O
to O
the O
customer H 12 0-0-2
. O

The O
system H 1
must O
also O
print O
a O
receipt H 0 2
summarizing O
the O
information O
of O
the O
return O
transaction H 0 0-2
performed O
by O
the O
customer H 12 0-0-2
. O

The O
system H 1
is O
also O
used O
by O
an O
operator H 0 2
. O

The O
latter H 15
will O
need O
to O
know O
the O
number O
of O
items O
returned O
for O
each O
type O
during O
the O
day O
. O

He H 15
will O
also O
be O
able O
to O
modify O
the O
information O
on O
the O
types H 5 2
of O
cans H 4 2-2
and O
bottles H 3 2-2-0
accepted O
by O
the O
system H 1 0-2-0-0
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
system H 1
must O
warn O
the O
operator H 15 2
, O
by O
triggering O
an O
alarm R
signal H 0 2-2
, O
if O
there O
is O
any O
problem H 0 0-0-2
in O
the O
machine H 2 0-0-0-2
. O

The O
problems H 17
that O
the O
machine H 2 2
may O
encounter O
can O
be O
of O
three O
kinds H 0 4-0
: O
a O
can O
or O
a O
bottle O
blocked O
, O
no O
paper O
in O
the O
roll O
for O
printing O
receipts O
, O
or O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
money O
in O
the O
machine O
. O
