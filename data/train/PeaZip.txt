PeaZip H 1 0

that H 1 0-0-1
could O

used O 
by O 
any O 
user H 14 0-0-0-2
of O

PeaZip R 
users H 14
can O 
be O 
divided O 
into O 
two O 
main O 
categories H 0 4
: O 
to O 
the O 
ones O 
that O 
have O 
already O 
used O 
an O 
archiving O 
and O 
compression O 
application O 
and O 
to O 
all O 
the O 
rest O 
. O 

Even O 
though O 
PeaZip O
functions O 
are O 
relatively O 
simple O 
and O 
PeaZip O 
’s O 
interface O 
is O 
pleasant O 
and O 
user O 
friendly O 
, O 
users H 14
included O 
in O 
both O 
categories H 16 4
, O 
should O 
read O 
the O 
tutorials H 0 2-0
and O 
help O 
documents H 0 2-0-0
that O 
have O 
been O 
written O 
about O 
the O 
particular O 
application H 1 0-0-2-2
( O 
and O 
are O 
either O 
available O 
in O 
sites O 
that O 
are O 
mentioned O 
in O 
following O 
chapter O 
or O 
inside O 
the O 
application O 
) O 
, O 
so O 
as O 
to O 
inform O 
themselves H 14 1-0-0-0-0 
on O 
the O 
application H 1 0-0-0-0-0-2
scope O 
and O 
needs O 
that O 
it O 
covers O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
use O 
in O 
full O 
extend O 
all O

featured O

application O 
, O

Another O 
distinction O 
of O 
PeaZip R  
users H 14
in O 
categories H 16 4
, O 
could O 
be O 
made O 
according O 
to O 
user O 
’s O 
experience O 
and O 
knowledge O 
on O 
using O 
computer O 
systems O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
case O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
the O 
distinction O 
into O 
a O 
discrete O 
number O 
of O 
categories O 
is O 
not O 
easy O 
, O 
because O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
possible O 
to O 
put O 
unambiguous O 
boarders O 
between O 
categories O 
according O 
to O 
users’ O 
experience O 
and O 
knowledge O 
level O 
on O 
using O 
computer O 
systems O 
, O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
non-countable O 
amount O 
. O 

Still O 
, O 
in O 
general O 
, O 
it O 
could O 
be O 
claimed O 
that O 
users H 14
with O 
larger O 
experience O 
and O 
knowledge O 
on O 
using O 
computer O 
systems O 
, O 
could O 
use O 
more O 
easily O 
some O 
advanced O 
features O 
offered O 
by O 
PeaZip H 1 2
, O 
such O 
as O 
executing O 
its O 
function O 
in O 
command O 
prompt O 
. O
